07-aug-2006 v2r10p1   JP Fix bug in null value code which caused seg faults if a null
                         value was actually encountered.
04-apr-2006  v2r10 JP Add support for vectors of bools and strings, and some support for
                      null values.
15-mar-2006   v2r9 JP Add implementation for vectors of strings.
27-feb-2006 v2r8p5 JP Make checksum code more careful when errors occur, and fix some
                      file issues which were making the unit test fail on Windows.
22-feb-2006 v2r8p4 JP Update checksums in every file extension while closing files.

                      output target types for all common numeric types.
06-dec-2005   v2r8 JP Add support for getting vectors and scalars of all common
                      floating point and integer types, converting them all to double
                      precision output targets.
03-nov-2005   v2r7 JP Generalize Root-specific table implementation to handle floats
                      as well as doubles.

                      and getComment methods.

                      copying whole files at a time.
06-apr-2005 v2r2p2 JP Change code to eliminate compiler warnings on Windows.
05-apr-2005 v2r2p1 JP Write floating-point keywords so they look like floating-point
                      values, even if they happen to convert to integer values. Some
                      internal refactoring concerning FITS file creation.
07-mar-2005 v2r2p0 JP Added ITipFile and subclasses to support file-wide access.

                      2) Writing a string containing a number to a numeric field didn't work.
                      3) TipException::code was returning 1 for all errors.
21-jan-2005 v2r1p1 JP Link against libHist to prevent problems loading libTreePlayer.so
                      on Linux with Root 4.x.
18-jan-2005 v2r1   JP Add support for history and comments in extensions,
                      for creation of files without templates, and
                      access to slices of images.
16-dec-2004 v2r0p1 JP Changes to fix problems compiling on Windows.
